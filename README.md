# google-analytics-php-library

This is a small Wordpress plugin I cooked up in order to be able to send hits to Google Analytics, server-side, using Google Measurement Protocol. With that i'm able to send events, pageviews and transactions.

I claim no ownership on this code, as it's largely based on the work of Stu Miller : http://www.stumiller.me/implementing-google-analytics-measurement-protocol-in-php-and-wordpress/

# Pull request #
I'd like to keep it simple. 
- If you want to make this plugin more complete ( = add more features), then maybe fork it and make it an other project. 
- Otherwise, do not hesitate to fork / pull request if you think there are improvements to be done.
