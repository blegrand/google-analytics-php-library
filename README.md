# google-analytics-php-library
A library I cooked up to send events, pageviews and e-commerce transactions to Google Analytics, using PHP / Google Measurement Protocol.

Based on the work of Stu Miller : http://www.stumiller.me/implementing-google-analytics-measurement-protocol-in-php-and-wordpress/

Currently in the form of a Wordpress Plugin I use on a few projects. Feel free to improve it, as I'm sure there's a lot to improve here.
